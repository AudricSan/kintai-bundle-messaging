# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

This is the standalone distribution repo for the official "Messaging" bundle
of [Kintai](https://github.com/AudricSan/Kintai). It used to live inside the
main Kintai monorepo at `src/Bundles/Messaging/` and was extracted so it can
be installed independently, the same way any third-party bundle would be
(see `docs/creating-a-bundle.md` in the main Kintai repo for the full bundle
distribution model — manifest, registry, installer).

There is no build or test suite in this repo (no `composer.json`, no
PHPUnit). The code is not runnable or functionally testable standalone: every
class under `src/` depends on `kintai\Core\*` (repositories, middleware,
`Request`/`Response`, `ViewRenderer`, `PermissionService`, etc.) that only
exist inside a running Kintai instance. Verifying a behavior change means
installing the bundle into a real Kintai instance, not running anything in
this repo. CI here only checks PHP syntax and manifest validity (see
"CI and branches" below) — it cannot catch logic errors.

Kintai never `git clone`/`pull`s bundles (many shared-hosting environments
have no `git` CLI available to PHP) — `BundleInstallerService` always
downloads a tagged GitHub Release's zipball. This repo's only "build output"
is therefore the GitHub Release itself; nothing here gets compiled or
packaged.

## CI and branches

This repo mirrors the branch/release model of the main Kintai repo:

- `main`, `alpha`, and `beta` are protected branches — no direct push; land
  changes via a PR (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). New work targets `alpha` (the
  active channel); promote a line forward by merging `alpha` → `beta` → `main`.
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs a `test` job (PHP syntax check via
  `php -l` on every `.php` file, plus JSON validation of `bundle.json` and
  `lang/*.json`) on every push and PR to these branches. This is the required
  status check gating merges.
- Merging into any of the three branches triggers
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tags and publishes a GitHub Release
  — see "Release process" below.

## Release process

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on push to `alpha`, `beta`, or
`main` (i.e. on every merge, since those branches are protected) and computes
and pushes the tag itself — never tag or `gh release create` by hand:

- Version line `X.Y` comes from `version` in `bundle.json`, which is always
  written as the placeholder `X.Y.0` and is only bumped by hand when opening a
  new release line (new `Y`).
- `alpha`/`beta` merges tag `vX.Y.Z` as a prerelease, where `Z` is the highest
  existing `vX.Y.*` tag + 1 — a counter shared and cumulative across alpha and
  beta within the same line, never reset between them.
- `main` merges tag `vX.Y.0` as the stable release for that line. If `vX.Y.0`
  already exists, the job skips cleanly (a line only ever gets one stable
  release; further fixes require opening a new line).
- Release notes are extracted from `CHANGELOG.md`: `## [Unreleased]` for
  alpha/beta (falling back to `## [X.Y.0]` if `Unreleased` is empty, i.e. the
  release commit already renamed it), or `## [X.Y.0]` directly for `main`. A
  push to a channel with no matching CHANGELOG section fails the job — always
  update `CHANGELOG.md` in your PR before merging.

## Architecture

- `bundle.json` — manifest read by Kintai's bundle installer/registry: slug,
  version, `kintai_core` compatibility range, `entry_class`.
- `src/MessagingBundle.php` — the entry point
  (`kintai\Bundles\Installed\Messaging\MessagingBundle`, extends
  `kintai\Core\BundleContract\Bundle`). `register()` binds
  `MessageRepositoryInterface` to `DatabaseMessageRepository` as a singleton,
  then calls `loadViewsFrom(..., 'messaging')` and `loadRoutesFrom(routes.php)`.
  `MessageRepositoryInterface` is owned and registered by this bundle, not by
  Kintai Core, with one exception: Kintai Core's `MessageCountMiddleware`
  (global middleware, shares the unread-message-count badge on every
  authenticated page) also depends on it, but wraps the call in a
  `try`/`catch` and degrades to showing `0` if the bundle isn't installed —
  it never assumes the interface is bound. Don't remove that guard if you
  ever touch `MessageCountMiddleware` on the Kintai side.
- `routes.php` — four groups: an SSE stream (`GET /messages/{id}/stream`,
  `MessageStreamController`, `AuthMiddleware` only), `/admin/messages/*`
  (`AuthMiddleware` + `PermissionMiddleware`, permissions
  `messaging.view`/`send`/`delete`), `/employee/messages/*` (`AuthMiddleware`
  only — no RBAC gate, every authenticated employee can message), and
  `/api/v1/messages/*` (REST, `ApiAuthMiddleware` only, no per-route
  permission — threads/participants/messages CRUD).
- `src/Controllers/Web/MessageController.php` — compose/list/thread/reply/
  delete for both the admin and employee route groups (same methods, mounted
  twice under different middleware).
- `src/Controllers/Web/MessageStreamController.php` — SSE endpoint backing
  live message updates in an open thread.
- `src/Controllers/Api/MessageController.php` — REST CRUD over threads,
  messages, and participants.
- `Views/*.php` — `messages.php` (inbox list), `messages-compose.php`,
  `messages-thread.php`. Registered under the `messaging::` view namespace.
- `lang/{en,fr,ja}.json` — bundle-scoped translation keys, merged into
  Kintai's `__()` translator. Keys used by `MessagingBundle` itself
  (`bundle_messaging`, `bundle_messaging_desc`) must exist in every locale file.
